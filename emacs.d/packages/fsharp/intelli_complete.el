;; Commentary:
;;
;;
;; ESense (ErlangSense) is a minor mode which provides features
;; similar to IntelliSense or CodeSense in other editors. It can be
;; enabled in an Erlang buffer or in the Erlang Shell buffer.
;;
;;
;; Configuration:
;; --------------
;;
;; The most important variables are `esense-index-directory' (which
;; does not need to be set if you use the default directory when
;; generating index files), `esense-module-search-directories',
;; `esense-include-search-directories' and `esense-indexer-program'.
;;
;; See other configuration variables in the "User Configuration"
;; section below.
;;
;;
;; Activation:
;; -----------
;;
;; In your .emacs add to erlang-load-hook:
;;
;;   (require 'esense)
;;
;; You can also set ESense-related configuration variables here:
;;
;;   (setq esense-indexer-program
;;      (concat (getenv "HOME") "/path/to/esense.sh"))
;;
;; Add to erlang-mode-hook
;;
;;   (esense-mode)
;;
;;
;; How it works:
;; -------------
;;
;; ESense uses a single activation key (by default F1) which does
;; different things depending on the context:
;;
;; If the cursor is ON a symbol it shows the documentation of the
;; symbol in a tooltip.
;;
;; If the cursor is at the end of a symbol it tries to complete the
;; symbol.
;;
;; If the cursor is in a parameter list and the two conditions above
;; are not met then it shows the documentation of the entity the
;; parameter list belongs to in a tooltip.
;;
;; If the modifier CTRL is also pressed then in contexts where
;; normally documentation is shown the definition of the symbol is
;; visited instead. The original location is put onto the tag stack
;; of etags, so M-* can be used to return to the starting location.
;;
;; ALT+<activation key> jumps to an arbitrary module/function with
;; completion.
;;
;; If the cursor is on an -include line the corresponding header file
;; is visited.
;;
;;
;; Code:
