        Experimental support for Intellisense in Emacs

February 2011



   ## Getting started


1) fsintellisense.exe is a program which communicates with F# compiler to
get all the Intellisense information. The first step is to make sure you
can run it. When you execute it, it should read commands on standard
input. Enter a random line and you should get "ERROR: Unknown command or
wrong arguments".

If you get an exception, you can copy FSharp.Compiler.dll and
FSharp.Compiler.Server.Shared.dll from F# (November release) into current
directory.

2) Edit intellisense.el and edit the intellisense-wrapper value to the actual
path.

3) Load intellisense.el (M-x load-file)

4) Open a F# buffer. Then M-x start-intellisense will run
fsintellisense.exe in background. You can play with those (temporary)
bindings:
  F1: display a tool-tip at point
  F2: do completion (also appears when you enter a dot)
  F4: display error messages from compiler


   ## Recompiling fsintellisense.exe

Here is the command-line I use:
  fsc.exe fsharpcompiler.fs tipFormatter.fs parser.fs program.fs -r "FSharp.Powerpack.dll"



   ## Documentation

fsintellisense.exe is a modified version of the Compiler example you can
get here:

    http://fsxplat.codeplex.com

In particular, this documentation is very useful:

   http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=fsharp%20intellisense%20tool&referringTitle=Home



   ## Bugs / Limitations / TODO

- It's not yet possible to add references (external dll files). I think
  the fsintellisense already handles it, so it should be easy to add.

- Completion works only on current buffer. We need a way to specify a
  project and give a list of source files.

- Error messages are not reported. We should display them in the code
  (underline errors in the buffer?)
